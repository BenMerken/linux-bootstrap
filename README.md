# GNU/Linux bootstrap

This repository contains my scripts and files necessary for bootstrapping my personal GNU/Linux system after a basic installation.

## Credits

Most of what I do GNU/Linux-wise is heavily inspired by Luke Smith's (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) and 
Derek Taylor's (GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1) work on YouTube. Huge thanks to them for their contributions to the greater public.
